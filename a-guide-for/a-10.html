      Pop art is a movement that emerged in the mid-to-late-1950’s in Britain and America. Commonly associated with artists such as Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and Jasper Jones, pop art draws its inspiration from popular and commercial culture such as advertising, pop music, movies and the media.
 
      The Pop Art movement adopted commercial methods like silk screening and the reproduction of existing works, downplaying the artist’s hand and subverting the idea of originality. In extreme contrast to Abstract Expressionism, the intense and highly expressive movement that had dominated the post-war art scene, Pop artists were emotionally detached and injected irony and wit into their paintings.

      Pop artists used food products from popular culture, often examining branded goods in their work. Andy Warhol is perhaps most famous for his Campbell’s Soup Cans, a series of paintings that resembled the mass-produced, printed advertisements by which Warhol was inspired. Warhol said of Campbell’s Soup, “I used to drink it. I used to have the same lunch every day, for 20 years, I guess, the same thing over and over again.”
 
      Cynthia Poole’s paintings also take branded items as their subject; popular objects include mass-produced confectionary, lifestyle and fashion magazines and cans of Heinz Baked Beans (a play on Warhol’s soup cans perhaps?). Poole paints each individual item with meticulous detail.  Her hyperrealist approach draws even more attention to the paintings and their popularity is not only on the grounds of the familiarity felt when faced with such objects.
