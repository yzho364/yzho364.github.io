    <p><h3>Art is the lifeblood of our communities, connecting us to the past, the present and the future. 
    <br>
    For centuries, our artists have handed on cultural knowledge to successive generations and,
   	<br>
   	within this rich tradition, forged contemporary expressions to mark their time.</h3></p>
