                        The invention of money took place before the
                        beginning of written history. Consequently, any story of how money first
                        developed is largely based on conjecture and logical inference.
                        The significant evidence establishes many things were bartered in ancient
                        markets that could be described as a medium of exchange. These included
                        livestock and grain – things directly useful in themselves – but also merely
                        attractive items such as cowrie shells or beads were exchanged for more
                        useful commodities. However, such exchanges would be better described as
                        barter, and the common bartering of a particular commodity (especially when
                        the commodity items are not fungible) does not technically make that
                        commodity "money" or a "commodity money" like the shekel – which was
                        both a coin representing a specific weight of barley, and the weight of that
                        sack of barley.

                        Due to the complexities of ancient history (ancient civilizations developing at
                        different paces and not keeping accurate records or having their records
                        destroyed), and because the ancient origins of economic systems precede
                        written history, it is impossible to trace the true origin of the invention of
                        money and the transition from "barter systems" to the "monetary systems".
                        Further, evidence in the histories supports the idea that money has taken two
                        main forms divided into the broad categories of money of account (debits and
                        credits on ledgers) and money of exchange (tangible media of exchange
                        made from clay, leather, paper, bamboo, metal, etc.).

                        more than 7,000 years have been found in
                        Mesopotamia, and documents from ancient Mesopotamia show lists of
                        expenditures, and goods received and traded and the history of accounting
                        evidences that money of account pre-dates the use of coinage by several
                        thousand years. David Graeber proposes that money as a unit of account
                        was invented when the unquantifiable obligation "I owe you one" transformed
                        into the quantifiable notion of "I owe you one unit of something". In this view,
                        money emerged first as money of account and only later took the form of
                        money of exchange.

                        In Politics Book 1:9 (c. 350 BC) the Greek
                        philosopher Aristotle contemplated the nature of money. He considered that
                        every object has two uses: the original purpose for which the object was
                        designed, and as an item to sell or barter.The assignment of monetary value
                        to an otherwise insignificant object such as a coin or promissory note arises
                        as people acquired a psychological capacity to place trust in each other and
                        in external authority within barter exchange.

                        With barter, an individual possessing any surplus of value, such as a measure
                        of grain or a quantity of livestock, could directly exchange it for something
                        perceived to have similar or greater value or utility, such as a clay pot or a
                        tool, however, the capacity to carry out barter transactions is limited in that it
                        depends on a coincidence of wants. For example, a farmer has to find
                        someone who not only wants the grain he produced but who could also offer
                        something in return that the farmer wants. Finding people to barter with is a
                        time-consuming process and this factor is most likely the main driving force
                        in the creation of monetary systems – people seeking a way to stop wasting
                        their time looking for someone to barter with.

                        There is no evidence, historical or contemporary, of a society in which barter
                        is the main mode of exchange. However, the general presumption that
                        monetary systems evolved from barter systems persists because it is
                        unreasonable to presume that monetary systems magically appeared. The
                        psychological elements required for a barter system to exist and function are
                        not only far simpler than those required for a simple monetary system, but
                        every historical example of monetary systems requires and incorporates the
                        basic psychological elements that make barter possible. It is very simple to
                        trade a piece of meat for a piece of fruit, but to create and use tools to make
                        hash marks on a stick or piece of leather to represent that someone gave you
                        a piece of meat and now you owe them a piece of meat is a far more complex
                        set of thought processes requiring a knowledge of making tools, knowledge of
                        crude numerical systems, etc.. Even more intellectually complicated than this
                        example would be creating tokens that abstractly represented a claim on
                        goods stored in a warehouse, and further still, creating metal tokens (which
                        would require knowledge of mining & refining metal and creating coins)
                        requires an even more evolved state of mind than any of these other
                        examples.
