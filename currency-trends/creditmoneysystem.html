                <h2>What is Credit Money</h2>
                <p>
                        Credit money is any future monetary claim against an individual that can be used to buy goods and services. There are many forms of credit money, such as IOUs, bonds and money market accounts. Virtually any form of financial instrument that cannot or is not meant to be repaid immediately is credit money.
                </p>
                <h2>
                        BREAKING DOWN Credit Money
                </h2>
                <p>
                        During the crusades of the middle ages, the Knights Templar of the Roman Catholic church, a religious order that was heavily armed and dedicated to holy war, held valuables and goods in trust. This led to the creation of a modern system of credit accounts that is still prevalent today. Public trust has waxed and waned in credit money institutions over the years, depending on economic, political, and social factors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                        Credit Money and Debt Markets
                </h2>
                <p>
                        As noted above, specific types of credit money include bonds. These are a major segment of the financial markets. For example, the market for U.S. government debt (Treasury bonds or T-bonds and Treasury notes or T-notes) ticked in at $14 trillion in January 2018. In 2018, the size of the global debt markets (more than $100 trillion) was near twice the size of the equity markets (close to $64 trillion). Together they form the global capital markets. The U.S. capital markets are the largest worldwide, with the U.S. equities market being 2.4x and the U.S. bond markets being 1.6x the size of the runner-up, the European Union. U.S. capital markets account for 65% of total funding for economic activity and drive domestic growth.

                <p>
                        Bonds allow governments (at the national, state, and local level), corporations, and nonprofits like colleges and universities, to access funds for a variety of growth projects, including funding roads, new buildings, dams or other infrastructure. Corporations will often borrow specifically to grow their business, buy property and equipment, acquire other companies, or invest in research and development for new products and services.
                </p>
                <p>
                        Outside of banks, bonds allow individual investors to assume the role of a lender in these situations. Public debt markets can open up a particular loan to thousands of investors, providing opportunities to fund portions of the capital needed. These public markets allow lenders to sell their bonds to other investors or to buy bonds from other individuals â€“ long after the original issuing organization raised capital.

                            Credit theories of money, also called debt
                            theories of money, are monetary economic theories concerning the
                            relationship between credit and money. Proponents of these theories, such
                            as Alfred Mitchell-Innes, sometimes emphasize that money and credit/debt
                            are the same thing, seen from different points of view. Proponents assert that
                            the essential nature of money is credit (debt), at least in eras where money is
                            not backed by a commodity such as gold. Two common strands of thought
                            within these theories are the idea that money originated as a unit of account
                            for debt, and the position that money creation involves the simultaneous
                            creation of debt. Some proponents of credit theories of money argue that
                            money is best understood as debt even in systems often understood as
                            using commodity money. Others hold that money equates to credit only in a
                            system based on fiat money, where they argue that all forms of money
                            including cash can be considered as forms of credit money.

                            The first formal credit theory of money arose in the 19th century.

                        Money has been widely understood to represent debt, though he concedes
                        that even prior to the modern era, there have been several periods where
                        rival theories like metallism have held sway.
